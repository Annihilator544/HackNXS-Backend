At the moment it seems like it Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) can do no wrong, and the stock price has risen accordingly. However, if you pay attention to Wall Street history, you’ll see that buying Nvidia today could easily be the wrong choice.

Nvidia’s stock gains have been incredible

Nvidia’s big story is that it makes powerful chips that can run artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI is a huge story in the tech sector these days, with virtually every company that can do it either working directly on an AI product or explaining to investors how AI will directly benefit it in some way (by increasing efficiency or automate tasks). , For example). Wall Street is very fond of AI and everything related to it.

Given Nvidia’s direct connection to space – and rising revenues from it – the stock has advanced rapidly. In the past year alone, the stock is up 223%. Over the past three years, the gain is over 550%. Over the past five years, the gain is over 1,860%.

NVDA graph

Scan the 10-year price chart above and it looks like Nvidia stock is soaring. The combination of that price increase and the general AI fever has investors clamoring to buy it. But don’t jump on this rocket without considering some Wall Street history.

Ben Graham’s Depression-era wisdom

Benjamin Graham is the man who helped train Warren Buffett and the author of the iconic investing book The intelligent investor. To paraphrase that Wall Street giant, even a good company can be a bad investment if you pay too much for it. A good example of this is Cisco systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). Take a look at the graph below.

It would be hard not to notice how similar the rocket-like trajectory is to the Nvidia chart above. But the most important feature of this chart is actually not the stock price, but the dates. The chart ends with the last trading day of 1999. The next chart brings the story into the present, and it should be more than enough to scare any investor who is currently all-in on Nvidia.

The story continues

CSCO chart

Simply put, after that massive spike during the dot-com boom, there was a massive crash during the dot-com bust. And Cisco’s stock price still hasn’t regained all the lost ground. If you bought near the peak, you’re still in the red on your investment (without considering reinvested dividends).

You could say this is a choice example, and that’s true. But there are no crystal balls on Wall Street, and it’s impossible to know for sure that Nvidia will avoid a similar fate. Although it now has a dominant position in AI-enabled chips, its competitors are working hard to catch up. If they do, Nvidia may not be so special anymore, and investors will likely turn sour on the stock. Wall Street history suggests that at some point Nvidia’s shocking stock price rally will end, just as it did for so many other stocks before it.

TSLA chart

Don’t forget gravity

Few companies can defy gravity forever. Tesla‘S (NASDAQ: TSLA) For example, shares have fallen about 50% since the electric car giant became sustainably profitable around 2020, and are down almost 60% from the record highs reached in late 2021. That may seem counterintuitive, but the stories are often more powerful on Wall Street than profits. And when a story gets old, high stock prices have a painful habit of crashing to the ground again.

Don’t let FOMO get the better of you. Nvidia may be a great company, but it can still be a terrible investment if you pay too much for it.

5 hours ago,thebharatexpressnews@gmail.com,3 Wall Street analysts explain why Nvidia’s best days are behind it,"AndreyKrav/iStock, Michael M. Santiago/Getty, Tyler Le/BI

Nvidia’s best days in the stock market may soon be behind it, three Wall Street analysts say.

They warn that the chipmaker’s rally could be disrupted by declining demand and inflated expectations.

Demand could fall as early as 2026 despite continued growth expectations, one analyst estimates.

Nvidia’s best days are likely behind it — and the stock’s meteoric rise amid the artificial intelligence craze is likely to start to falter this year, according to several Wall Street analysts.

This bearish stance comes amid a banner year so far for Nvidia, with the Jensen Huang-led company crushing earnings estimates quarter after quarter. The company is now worth more than Alphabet and Amazon, and just dethroned Tesla as the top stock pick among retail investors.

But the chipmaker’s monstrous gains could soon come to an end, according to Gil Luria, analyst at DA Davidson. He calls for a drop in Nvidia stock of as much as 20% by the end of the year, joining a handful of other strategists who are skeptical of Nvidia’s staggering stock market valuation.

It is unlikely that Nvidia will be able to maintain its rapid growth pace, as companies investing in AI will inevitably eventually drop out, Luria recently said in a conversation with BNN Bloomberg. In a note, he gave the stock a “hold” rating and a $620 price target, the lowest estimate on Wall Street.

“Many of its major customers are stocking up on its GPU products,” Luria said, pointing to Nvidia’s biggest buyers of AI chips, such as Microsoft and Amazon. “But as they reach the capacity they need, they won’t continue to buy it for years to come, which is what Nvidia’s current estimates imply.”

According to Bloomberg data, Nvidia is expected to see earnings per share rise to $24.75 over the twelve months through the first quarter of 2025. That’s almost double last year’s adjusted earnings per share of $13.

DA Davidson also expects demand for Nvidia products to decline in 2026.

The story continues

“The higher we go this year, the more we will fall next year,” Luria warned.

Other commentators have warned about Nvidia’s sky-high valuation. Deutsche Bank maintained its “hold” rating on the stock in a recent note, pointing to the chipmaker’s already high price. Analysts had a price target of $850 per share, implying a 5% decline from the stock’s current levels.

“We remained impressed with NVDA’s pace of innovation and continue to view the company as the undisputed leader in AI, but also believe that this vision remains quite well known (see this year’s impressive rally) and is adequately reflected in the already high valuation,” said analysts from the German bank in a note dated March 18.

Nvidia also faces risks due to the sheer amount of competition in the AI ​​space. No company is as close to dominating the market as Nvidia, but other chipmakers like Microsoft and Amazon are certainly “trying to give it a try,” according to Brian Colello, an equity strategist at Morningstar.

“The cloud companies can just look at how much they’re spending on Nvidia GPUs and then… try to build these chips internally to run specific AI workloads,” Colello told Business Insider in an interview. “Nvidia has huge operating margins and best-in-class profitability, so that gives many companies incentives to join the fray.”

Nvidia shares could also be hit if the economy enters a slowdown, Colello speculated. If customers like Microsoft scale back their GPU spending, it could spell trouble for Nvidia, as investors already have high expectations for the stock.

Morningstar assigned the stock a three-star rating, or a neutral rating, with a price target of $910. That implies shares will remain largely flat for the rest of the year, with Nvidia shares trading around $900 this week.

Nvidia’s bears are certainly in the minority as the chipmaker continues its rally, with shares up 86% from year-to-date levels. Investors will be keeping an eye on the company’s upcoming earnings report, due May 22, with the company expected to post earnings per share of $5.13, according to Nasdaq data.

5 hours ago,thebharatexpressnews@gmail.com,280 billion reasons to buy Nvidia stock right now,"Nvidia‘S (NASDAQ: NVDA) The data center activities grew at an eye-catching pace in the past financial year. The company dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards, which are deployed in large numbers by major cloud computing and AI companies.

Data center revenue rose a whopping 217% to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending January 28, 2024). If you’re wondering how much space Nvidia’s data center business will have in the future, says Japanese investment bank analyst Vijay Rakesh Mizuho recently explained why he believes this segment’s white-hot growth is far from over.

Nvidia’s data center revenues could multiply from here

According to Mizuho, ​​Nvidia’s data center revenues could increase 87% to about $89 billion in the current fiscal year. More importantly, Rakesh predicts that Nvidia’s data center revenue could soar to $280 billion by 2027 (which will coincide with most of the company’s 2028 fiscal year).

That suggests that Nvidia’s data center revenue could grow 56% annually over the next four years, and there’s a good chance that this target will indeed be achieved.

This impressive growth will be driven by the ramp-up of Nvidia’s new chips. The company will launch the H200, B100 and B200 AI chips in 2024 and 2025. Customers are already lining up to get their hands on these processors.

The H200 will be available from this quarter. Companies like Amazon, MicrosoftGoogling, and Oracle According to Nvidia, they are expected to launch cloud instances powered by these chips this year. Meanwhile, these cloud computing providers have also expressed interest in Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell AI processors, which the company claims will deliver massive performance and efficiency upgrades over the Hopper architecture it launched a few years ago .

The Blackwell products should be available “later this year,” and the company claims “Amazon Web Services, Dell Technologiesgoogle, MetaMicrosoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI” are among the many companies expected to adopt this platform. That wouldn’t be surprising, as Nvidia promises that its Blackwell platform can enable organizations to “build and run real-time generative AI on large language models with trillion parameters, up to 25x less costs and energy consumption than its predecessor.”

The story continues

With companies like Microsoft reportedly looking to spend a whopping $100 billion on building massive AI-focused data centers, it’s easy to see why Nvidia expects strong demand for its upcoming offerings. Management explained on the last earnings call that it expects “supply of next-generation products to be limited as demand far exceeds supply.”

Nvidia has strengthened its supply chain with support from its foundry partner TSMC. The waiting time of the current generation flagship, the H100, has dropped from 8 to 11 months to 3 to 4 months. With TSMC aiming to at least double the packaging capacity of its advanced chips this year, followed by further expansion in 2025, Nvidia’s next-generation chip offerings should continue to improve.

As such, Nvidia could achieve Mizuho’s forecast of $280 billion in data center revenue by 2027. It’s worth noting that Rakesh expects the overall AI data center market to generate $400 billion in revenue by that year, meaning Nvidia would control 70% of data center revenue. of the market, a decline from the current share of more than 90%.

How much upside can the stock deliver from the data center boom?

Nvidia generated $13.1 billion in revenue from its other segments (gaming, professional visualization and automotive) last year. Assuming these other segments don’t see growth and generate the same amount of revenue in fiscal 2028, Nvidia’s revenue could still reach $293 billion in four years, based on Mizuho’s guidance.

The stock currently trades at 37 times sales, a premium to its five-year average sales multiple of 18, thanks to the stunning growth it has achieved over the past year. Assuming Nvidia achieves even 15x sales in four years, the market capitalization based on the above revenue outlook would increase to $4.4 trillion, doubling from current levels.

But Nvidia’s other segments are not standing still. The company is growing at a nice pace in the gaming market, which offers another solid growth opportunity thanks to AI. So it could even exceed the projections outlined above and provide stronger upside potential for investors. Overall, Nvidia’s data center supremacy suggests the stock is built to outperform the market over the long term, making it a top AI stock to buy even after the huge gains it has seen over the past year has booked.

6 hours ago,Tipranks,"‘Expect a Crash Once Reality Kicks In,’ Says Top Investor About Nvidia Stock","History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes, goes the saying, and we might just be about to witness how the famous maxim gets applied to the stock market.

At least, that is the opinion of 5-star investor Robbe Delaet. It’s almost exactly 24 years since Cisco Systems became the world’s most valuable company, over taking Microsoft to claim top spot. It was a very brief stay at the summit for the networking giant – one day only, actually – and in hindsight signalled the peak of the dot-com tech bubble. Following which, CSCO shares collapsed by 90% between March 2000 and October 2002 and since those heady days the stock has delivered returns of -37% over the past 24 years.

Fast-forward to the here and now, and it’s no tall order to imagine Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) claiming the title of the world’s most valuable company shortly. The past year’s huge rally has made the chip colossus the world’s 3rd most valuable firm with a market cap of $2.2 trillion. If it does claim the No. 1 spot, the company vacating pole position will interestingly once again be Microsoft.

Just like the hype driving the dot-com tech boom, Nvidia’s huge market gains have been driven by a theme; AI, of course, with the company cornering the market for AI chips and investors piling in by the bucketload.

But now Delaet is issuing a warning on Nvidia stock, believing it could be about to get the same treatment afforded Cisco.

“Investors pumped money into Cisco Systems, which was the best-performing company at that time. However, they forgot one important thing in their investment analysis – assessing the sustainability of this growth rate,” Delaet explained. “They believed the numbers would keep skyrocketing. That’s not possible if customers reduce or even entirely stop ordering after they fully built out their infrastructure need for the coming decade.”

So, it’s a simple argument, essentially. As happened with Cisco, Delaet says that once more, “investors and analysts are cheering the current dominance of Nvidia, without questioning the sustainability of growth rates in the future.”

Lots of questions needs to be addressed, says Delaet. What if clients realize they’ve invested excessively and already possess AI capabilities sufficient for years ahead? What are the potential implications should Nvidia’s dominant position diminish, and rivals such as AMD and Chinese firms gain traction in the market? What are the potential consequences if major clients manage to develop their own AI chip technology?

“Let me tell you what will happen if one of these things occur,” Delaet answers, “Analyst forecasts will not be met. Sales will not grow steadily from $61 billion to $157 billion by FY2027, and net profit margins will definitely not stay at 52%.”

While the present seems rosy, Delaet cautions investors to ready themselves for possible bumps ahead. AI momentum favors Nvidia, but should any flaws become apparent, the stock will have a “very, very tough time as today’s valuation is extrapolating perfection into the future.”

“Just like with Cisco Systems, I fear that the last buyers of this boom will face significant downside and zero returns for decades to come,” Deleat summed up. As such, he rates NVDA stock a Hold (i.e., Neutral). (To watch Deleat’s track record, click here)

That’s one view but it certainly differs to the prevailing one on Wall Street. NVDA claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on a mix of 39 Buys vs. just 2 Holds. At $983.84, the average target suggests shares will climb ~12% higher over the coming months. (See Nvidia stock forecast)

It’s almost exactly 24 years since Cisco Systems became the world’s most valuable company, over taking Microsoft to claim top spot.
Fast-forward to the here and now, and it’s no tall order to imagine Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) claiming the title of the world’s most valuable company shortly.
But now Delaet is issuing a warning on Nvidia stock, believing it could be about to get the same treatment afforded Cisco.

0 hours ago,Tom's Hardware,MSI rolls out a new high-end Nvidia gaming GPU in China — GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Ventus 3X comes as a more affordable option,"MSI has unveiled the GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Ventus 3X, the brand's third custom GeForce RTX 4090D for the Chinese market. The graphics card arrives as a cheaper option for Chinese consumers who don't require all the bells and whistles of the GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Gaming X Slim or GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Suprim X.

The GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Ventus 3X is a virtual copy of MSI's outgoing GeForce RTX 4090 Ventus 3X, down to the exact dimensions (322 x 136 x 62 mm). The Ventux 3X is the budget or entry-level version of the RTX 4090D in MSI's product stack. The card features the most basic design of the three, incorporating a silver-metal shroud with black fans. It also features 6th-generation MSI fan blades, a square-shaped core heat pipe design, airflow steering technology, plus a nickel-plated copper base.

Like the other two more expensive models, the GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Ventus 3X has a boost clock of 2,520 MHz out of the box. However, using MSI's included MSI Center software, you can push it to 2,535 MHz. The 24GB of GDDR6X memory runs at 21 Gbps with a 384-bit memory bus.

The GeForce RTX 4090D 24G Ventus 3X draws its power from a standard 16-pin power connector. MSI recommends a minimum 850W power supply. Regarding display outputs, the graphics card offers two HDMI 2.1a ports and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. It supports up to four monitors simultaneously and a maximum display resolution of 7680 x 4320.

The RTX 4090D is Nvidia's China-exclusive RTX 4090 replacement, designed to counter U.S. import regulations. The GPU features 12% fewer cores and a 25W lower TDP. 3rd party outlets report that the 4090D is roughly 10% slower than the RTX 4090 and only 5% slower in gaming workloads. However, Nvidia never turned off overclocking, so users can achieve RTX 4090 stock performance.
