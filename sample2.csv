1 day ago,The New Indian Express,Dabur expects mid-single digit revenue growth in Q4,"NEW DELHI: On account of sluggish demand trends, FMCG major Dabur is expecting a mid-single digit growth in its consolidated revenues in the recently concluded March quarter. The company stated that the past year was “challenging” for consumer demand but it expects improvement going ahead.

Dabur added that the inorganic revenue growth which was to the extent of around 2.3% till YTD ‘Dec 2023 on account of Badshah acquisition is now factored in the base.
